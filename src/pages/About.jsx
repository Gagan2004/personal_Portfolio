      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Hey, Iâ€™m Gagan â€” a full-stack developer and creative technologist with a deep interest in building intuitive, powerful, and story-driven digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Iâ€™ve developed projects ranging from a full-featured <span className="text-lime-300 font-semibold">Airbnb clone</span> to clever automation tools and content engines powered by AI. I'm particularly excited by the potential of combining design, animation, and smart backend logic to bring ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of AI, storytelling, and web technologies through projects like this Omnitrix-themed portfolio, motivational content creation, and smart utility bots that blur the line between fun and function.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
        When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m either crafting short films, breaking down complex tech into bite-sized stories, or experimenting with ways to make learning more visual and engaging.
      </p>
